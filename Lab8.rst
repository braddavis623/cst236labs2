Analysis Questions
******************

#. How was this test useful?

	It determines whether further testing is useful and whether the build
	you want to test is functional to even a basic degree.

#. How did you report errors found by this test? How difficult would it be for a developer
 to debug these errors

	I didn't implement error reporting. It would then be difficult to make meaningful 
	use of my results on a large scale.	

#. What other things would be useful to have in a sanity test?

	Definitely error reporting. This is a broad testing method, so just enough 
	to point the developer in the direction of the problem.

#. How would you sanity test a UI? A database interface? a webpage? a C# program?

	With a UI and a Webpage, I would test that the links/buttons and input fields
	function. For a database or C# program, I would attempt the same method as
	this lab requires.
