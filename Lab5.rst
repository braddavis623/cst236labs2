Kevin Davis CST 236 Lab 5

------------------------

-


#. What was the hardest part of this lab?


	Making up a performance test and figuring out how to implement it without 
	knowing what facilities were available for its implementation.

#. What is the difference between performance testing and performance measurement?


	Performance testing needs a requirement in order to determine whether the 
	code passes or fails. Performance measurement just measures current performance.

#. What new bugs did you encounter with the new code?


	I did not encounter any new bugs except an occasional glitch that caused 
	tests one and three to fail together.

#. Did you mock anything to speed up performance testing? Do you see any issues with this?


	I did not mock the perforamance test portion. It seems that it might yeild better
	results than would be reflected without mock.


#. How long did this lab take to accomplish?

	I spent 5-7 hours when the lab was assigned, but had to move on. Now it's been 
	another 3-4 hours.
